## 🚀 Key Features

### 🔐 Multi-Dimensional Risk Scoring Engine
SCOPE's core is its comprehensive 4-pillar risk evaluation framework:

#### 🌐 Risk Level Mapping
All risk scores are expressed on a 0–100 scale and assigned one of four risk levels:
- **85–100**: Low Risk 🟢 Green
- **70–84**: Medium Risk 🟡 Yellow  
- **50–69**: High Risk 🟠 Orange
- **0–49**: Critical Risk 🔴 Red

#### 🔒 Cybersecurity Posture (40% weight)
Assesses vendor's exposed digital footprint, technical controls, and threat readiness:
- **Vulnerability Management** (5%): Open CVEs, patch cycles, outdated software
- **Attack Surface (ASM)** (5%): Open ports, misconfigured services, exposed assets
- **Web/Application Security** (5%): TLS version, CMS exposure, authentication endpoints
- **Cloud & Infrastructure Security** (5%): S3 buckets, API security, cloud config hygiene
- **Email Security** (5%): SPF, DKIM, DMARC presence
- **Code Repository Exposure** (5%): Hardcoded secrets, public GitHub leaks

- **Sector Risk Profile** (4%): Industry classification (e.g., Finance = High risk)
- **Company Size & Reach** (3%): Global footprint, employee size, asset sprawl
- **Infrastructure Jurisdiction** (3%): Location of hosted systems and legal exposure
- **Concentration / Monopoly Risk** (2%): Critical vendor used across multiple internal systems
- **Environmental Exposure** (2%): Natural disaster risk at HQ or primary DC

#### 🔊 Reputation & Exposure History (20% weight)
Examines breach records and external signals of compromise:
- **Data Breach History** (6%): Known breaches, data loss events
- **Credential / Data Leaks** (5%): Leaked email/password, exposed keys
- **Brand Spoofing & Phishing Kits** (3%): Typosquatting, cloned sites, social spoofing
- **Dark Web & Pastebin Presence** (3%): Mentions in threat actor channels, paste dumps
- **Social/Public Sentiment** (3%): Media coverage, defacements, hacktivist attention

#### 🔗 Asset Criticality Modifier
Vendors are prioritized based on service importance:
- **Critical**: 1.25x multiplier
